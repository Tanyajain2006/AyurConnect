# AyurConnect
This project proposes a cloud-based platform for Ayurvedic practitioners, centralizing patient records and replacing manual systems. It features a smart diet planner merging nutrition and Ayurvedic principles, Panchakarma scheduling, and a patient portal to streamline tasks, reduce errors, and improve care.
